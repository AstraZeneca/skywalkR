This plot shows distribution of Pareto levels calculated following specified variables 
and directions of optimization. The most optimal genes according to multiple objectives
belong to Pareto level 1 (highlighted with a green bar). 

The plot aims to show how discriminative is the selection of objectives and optimization 
directions. It might be useful to find such combination of objectives, so that the 
number of optimal genes (Pareto level 1) is not overwhelming. Note, that by relaxing 
too many objectives (setting them to 'any') we are left with too many optimal genes.
