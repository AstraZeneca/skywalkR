### Share the love ‚ù§Ô∏è

Think skywalkR is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person, via Twitter or a blog post.

### Ask a question ‚ÅâÔ∏è

Using our_package and got stuck? Post your question as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we cannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.

Want to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by [email]: mailto:anna.gogleva@astrazeneca.com.

### Propose an idea üí°

Have an idea for a new skywalkR feature? Take a look at the [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a bug üêõ

Using SkywalkR and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* Your operating system name and version (e.g. Mac OS 10.13.6).
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Improve the documentation üìñ

Noticed a typo in documentation? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!
